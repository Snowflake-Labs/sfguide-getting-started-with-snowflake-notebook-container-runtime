# Getting Started with Snowflake Container Runtime

## Overview

You can run Snowflake Notebooks on Snowpark Container Services through Container Runtime. Snowpark Container Services gives you a flexible container infrastructure that supports building and operationalizing a wide variety of workflows entirely within Snowflake. Container Runtime provides software and hardware options to support advanced data science and machine learning workloads on Snowpark Container Services. Compared to Virtual warehouses, Container Runtime provides a more flexible compute environment where you can install packages from multiple sources and select compute resources, including GPU machine types, while still running SQL queries on warehouses for optimal performance.

This Quickstart will take you through the steps of running Snowflake Notebooks with Container Runtime. We will install packages, train a model using pre-installed packages, and view logs.
